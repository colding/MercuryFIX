#
# This is a whitespace delimited list of endpoints (interface and port
# number) on which Mercury will listen for incomming FIX connection
# atttempts. 
#
# No FIX_INTERFACE value may refer to the same IP address. A
# maximum of 128 values is supported.
#
# The function of the FIX_INTERFACE option is to identify the IP
# addresses on which Mercury will listen for incomming network
# connections. They may be defined using a numeric IP address or the
# name of a network interface card (a.k.a. a NIC). An exception is
# "localhost" which will always be expanded to "127.0.0.1".
#
# If a FIX_INTERFACE value is prefixed by '4' it will be
# interpreted as the name or numeric IP address of an IPv4 enabled
# NIC. This prefix is only valid for active network interfaces with
# IPv4 addresses.
#
# If a FIX_INTERFACE value is prefixed by '6' it will be
# interpreted as the name or numeric IP address of an IPv6 enabled
# NIC. This prefix is only valid for active network interfaces with
# IPv6 addresses.
#
# FIX_INTERFACE values MUST have the protocol verison prefix '4' or
# '6'.
#
# If a FIX_INTERFACE value is prefixed by 'L' then it will bind to
# that interface and listen for connections to it.
#
# If a FIX_INTERFACE value is prefixed by 'C' then it will connect to
# that interface.
#
# FIX_INTERFACE values MUST be prefixed by 'L' or 'C' after the
# protocol version prefix.
#
# "%Llocalhost" will be resolved to "127.0.0.1" and "+Llocalhost" will
# be resolved to "::1".
#
# All configured network connections will be of the protocol family
# PF_INET or PF_INET6 respectively unless FIX_INTERFACE is
# specified as "%localhost" or "+localhost" in which case they will be
# of the protocol family PF_LOCAL.
#
# The port number is specified by following the network address with
# a single '|' character and then the port number which must be an
# integer in the range 1 through 65535. Please consider following
# the guide lines in "http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers".
#
# WARNING: IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ONLY
# AUTHORIZED CLIENTS CAN CONNECT TO MERCURY USING THESE ENDPOINTS.
#
# It is an error if no FIX_INTERFACE, including a port number, is
# specified.
#
# Examples, all on port 57738:
#          6Leth0|57738                          (an IPv6 enabled NIC)

#
# This is the endpoint (interface and port number) on which Mercury
# will listen for incomming commands. Please note that only one
# COMMAND_PORT and only one COMMAND_INTERFACE may be defined, in
# contrast to FIX_INTERFACE which may specify several values.
#
# The function of the COMMAND_INTERFACE option is to identify the IP
# address on which Mercury will listen for incomming commands. It may
# be defined using a numeric IP address or the name of a network
# interface card (a.k.a. a NIC). An exception is "localhost" which
# will always be expanded to "127.0.0.1".
#
# If the COMMAND_INTERFACE value is prefixed by '%' it will be
# interpreted as the name or numeric IP address of an IPv4 enabled
# NIC. This prefix is only valid for active network interfaces with
# IPv4 addresses.
#
# If the COMMAND_INTERFACE value is prefixed by '+' it will be
# interpreted as the name or numeric IP address of an IPv6 enabled
# NIC. This prefix is only valid for active network interfaces with
# IPv6 addresses.
#
# The COMMAND_INTERFACE option MUST be prefixed by '%' or '+'.
#
# "%localhost" will be resolved to "127.0.0.1" and "+localhost" will
# be resolved to "::1".
#
# The network connection will be of the protocol family PF_INET or
# PF_INET6 respectively unless COMMAND_INTERFACE is specified as
# "%localhost" or "+localhost" in which case it will be of the
# protocol family PF_LOCAL.
