MercuryFIX
==========

MercuryFIX is a FIX server in the making. Not at all usable or even
halfway finished yet, but you're welcome to take a look. 


GOALS
=====

A FIX server which:

* maintains an uninterrupted session even during software updates

* has focus on performance and robustness

* is reconfigurable while running - mid-session even where it makes
  sense


DOING
=====

Currently I'm working with the FIX IO library (utillib/fixio). When
that is done I'll move on to session management, or that is the plan
anyways.


TODO
==== 

* Cook up some code to let SQLite store and retrieve sent messages and
  the latest recieved/sent sequence number.

* Do something about the configuration classes. They are way too
  complex.

* Move to DB based configuration while I'm at it.

* Make a reasonable session implementation
